# Teaching Demonstration on QGIS2Web
Teaching demonstration for INFO 609: Introduction to GIS. This demo uses data from a CUNY project on black carbon pollution and environmental justice in Brooklyn. 
Students learn how to integrate geodatabase and WMS layers in QGIS, and export the code library using QGIS2Web on an OSM or Leaflet basemap (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis2web/). Students then publish the map on their own GitHub repositories.
